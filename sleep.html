          <h1>What is the ideal length of sleep?</h1>
          <small>July|20</small>
          <p>
            For adults, it is between 7-9 hours. However, as we age, we tend to
            need fewer hours of sleep, which can be as less as six. The
            challenge is the more you read about sleep, the more you start
            checking your sleep hours and just the knowledge that the amount you
            sleep is perhaps not within prescribed standards, even if you sleep
            well, can lead to sleep problems, where none earlier existed. It is
            a good idea to keep regular sleep hours and if the quality of your
            sleep is good, not to worry too much about whether you sleep for 6
            1/2 or 7 or 8 hours. Typically however, a sleep duration of less
            than 6 hours is considered to be harmful.

        <li>
          <h1>Does the quality of sleep matter?</h1>
          <small>July|20</small>
          <p>
            This probably matters more than the length of sleep. If you sleep
            for 8 hours but are constantly disturbed, or keep getting up, or
            donâ€™t get enough deep sleep, you may be worse off than someone who
            sleeps for 6 hours, but has undisturbed deep sleep. How do you know
            that you have had good sleep? Typically, the way you feel in the
            morning and throughout the day will help you understand whether you
            are sleeping well or not. If you constantly feel drowsy and sleepy
            during the day, it generally means that you are either sleeping less
            or the quality of your sleep is poor or both.
